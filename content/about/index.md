# Greetings, I'm Adam Kammeyer!

I'm a father, recreational developer, manager, avid comic book reader, and wishful cyclist. I've been working in I.T. in some fashion for almost 20 years. My current obsessions are my blended family, self-hosting services, and home automation. All the computers in my home run Linux. I may have a Raspberry Pi addiction.

My hope is to use this site to share my experiences and my knowledge with the world.
